# Glossary

## User Flow
> The term ‘flow’ depicts movement. Product creators need to consider the path in which the user will navigate through the website or app, prompting the creation of user flow. This path is divided into a series of steps that the user takes from the entry point through conversion funnels towards the final action (signup, purchase, etc.).

## User Journey

> In comparison with user flow, the user journey does not focus solely on individual states and elements that trigger those states; they have several layers of information — users’ feelings, thoughts, etc. (c) [Understanding User Journey vs. User Flow](https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/process/user-research/user-journey-vs-user-flow/)
